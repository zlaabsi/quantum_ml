## Quantum Gradient Descent

How to train quantum circuit-based models using gradient based methods ?

The goal in the case where we train a parameterized quantum circuit model is to minimize the cost or loss function which is the objective function via the vector of parameters. 

The expectation value is what weâ€™d expect to measure if we averaged out a large number of results.

The quantum approach has two fundamental steps :

1. Prepare the quantum state called the *ansatz*
2. Measure the expectation value 

We define our ansatz as the parametrized quantum circuit.
